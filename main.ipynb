       "{'news011.txt': 'A newly discovered glitch in Zoom\\'s screen sharing feature can accidentally leak sensitive information to other attendees in a call, according to the latest findings.\\nTracked as CVE-2021-28133, the unpatched security vulnerability makes it possible to reveal contents of applications that are not shared, but only briefly, thereby making it harder to exploit it in the wild.\\nIt\\'s worth pointing out that the screen sharing functionality in Zoom lets users share an entire desktop or phone screen, or limit sharing to one or more specific applications, or a portion of a screen. The issue stems from the fact that a second application that\\'s overlayed on top of an already shared application can reveal its contents for a short period of time.\\n\"When a Zoom user shares a specific application window via the \\'share screen\\' functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of other application windows which were not explicitly shared,\" SySS researchers Michael Strametz and Matthias Deeg noted. \"The contents of not shared application windows can, for instance, be seen for a short period of time by other users when those windows overlay the shared application window and get into focus.\"\\nThe flaw, which was tested on versions 5.4.3 and 5.5.4 across both Windows and Linux clients, is said to have been disclosed to the videoconferencing company on December 2, 2020. The lack of a fix even after three months could be attributed in part to the difficulty in exploiting the vulnerability.\\nBut nonetheless, this could have serious consequences depending on the nature of the inadvertently shared data, the researchers warned, adding a malicious participant of a Zoom meeting can take advantage of the weakness by making use of a screen capture tool to record the meeting and playback the recording to view the private information.\\nWhen reached for a response, a Zoom spokesperson said it\\'s working to address the issue. \"Zoom takes all reports of security vulnerabilities seriously,\" the company told The Hacker News via email. \"We are aware of this issue, and are working to resolve it.\"\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'news012.txt': 'The Office of the Washington State Auditor (SAO) on Monday said it\\'s investigating a security incident that resulted in the compromise of personal information of more than 1.6 million people who filed for unemployment claims in the state in 2020.\\nThe SAO blamed the breach on a software vulnerability in Accellion\\'s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) service, which allows organizations to share sensitive documents with users outside their organization securely.\\n\"During the week of January 25, 2021, Accellion confirmed that an unauthorized person gained access to SAO files by exploiting a vulnerability in Accellion\\'s file transfer service,\" the SAO said in a statement.\\nThe accessed information is said to have contained personal details of Washington state residents who filed unemployment insurance claims in 2020, as well as other data from local governments and state agencies.\\nThe exact information that may have been compromised include:\\nFull name\\nSocial security number\\nDriver\\'s license\\nState identification number\\nBank account number and bank routing number, and\\nPlace of employment\\nThe unauthorized access incident is believed to have occurred in late December of last year, although it appears the full scope of the intrusion wasn\\'t made aware until Accellion disclosed earlier this month that its file transfer application was the \"target of a sophisticated cyberattack.\"\\nThe Palo Alto-based cloud solutions company said on January 11 that it was made aware of a vulnerability in its legacy FTA software in mid-December, following which it claimed it addressed the issue and released a patch \"within 72 hours\" to the less than 50 customers affected.\\nAccellion also said it\\'s contracting with an \"industry-leading cybersecurity forensics firm\" to investigate the incident.\\nGiven that the compromised information can be abused to carry out identity theft or fraud, the SAO said it\\'s in the process of arranging measures to protect the identities of those whose information may have been contained within SAO\\'s files.\\nIn the meanwhile, the agency recommends reviewing account statements and credit reports, notifying financial institutions of any suspicious activity, and reporting any suspected incidents of identity theft to law enforcement.\\nIt\\'s worth noting that Accellion\\'s FTA software was used as an attack vector to strike two other organizations, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), in recent weeks.\\n',\n",
       " 'news013.txt': '21 people have been arrested across the UK as part of a nationwide cyber crackdown targeting customers of WeLeakInfo[.]com, a now-defunct online service that had been previously selling access to data hacked from other websites.\\nThe suspects used stolen personal credentials to commit further cyber and fraud offences, the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\\nOf the 21 arrested — all men aged between 18 and 38 — nine have been detained on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, nine for Fraud offences, and three are under investigation for both. The NCA also seized over £41,000 in bitcoin from the arrested individuals.\\nEarlier this January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the NCA, the Netherlands National Police Corps, the German Bundeskriminalamt, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland jointly seized the domain of WeLeakInfo.com.\\nLaunched in 2017, the service provided its users a search engine to access the personal information illegally obtained from over 10,000 data breaches and containing over 12 billion indexed stolen credentials, including, for example, names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and passwords for online accounts.\\nOn top of that, WeLeakInfo offered subscription plans, allowing unlimited searches and access to the results of these data breaches during the subscription period that lasted anywhere from one day ($2), one week ($7), one month ($25), or three months ($70).\\nThe cheap subscriptions made the website accessible to even entry-level, apprentice-type hackers, letting them get hold of a huge cache of data for as little as $2 a day, and in turn, use those stolen passwords to mount credential stuffing attacks.\\nFollowing the domain\\'s seizure in January, two 22-year-old men, one in the Netherlands and another in Northern Ireland, were arrested in connection with running the site. WeLeakInfo\\'s Twitter handle has since gone quiet.\\nThe NCA said besides being customers of the website, some of the arrested men had also purchased other cybercrime tools such as remote access Trojans (RATs) and crypters, with three other subjects found to be in possession of indecent images of children.\\n\"Cyber criminals rely on the fact that people duplicate passwords on multiple sites and data breaches create the opportunity for fraudsters to exploit that,\" NCA\\'s Paul Creffield said. \"Password hygiene is therefore extremely important.\"\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'news014.txt': 'The massive state-sponsored espionage campaign that compromised software maker SolarWinds also targeted Microsoft, as the unfolding investigation into the hacking spree reveals the incident may have been far more wider in scope, sophistication, and impact than previously thought.\\nNews of Microsoft\\'s compromise was first reported by Reuters, which also said the company\\'s own products were then used to strike other victims by leveraging its cloud offerings, citing people familiar with the matter.\\nThe Windows maker, however, denied the threat actor had infiltrated its production systems to stage further attacks against its customers.\\nIn a statement to The Hacker News via email, the company said —\\n\"Like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicious SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed. We have not found evidence of access to production services or customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications that our systems were used to attack others.\"\\nCharacterizing the hack as \"a moment of reckoning,\" Microsoft president Brad Smith said it has notified over 40 customers located in Belgium, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Spain, the UAE, the UK, and the US that were singled out by the attackers. 44% of the victims are in the information technology sector, including software firms, IT services, and equipment providers.\\nCISA Issues New Advisory\\nThe development comes as the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a fresh advisory, stating the \"APT actor [behind the compromises] has demonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft in these intrusions.\"\\n\"This threat poses a grave risk to the Federal Government and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations,\" it added.\\nBut in a twist, the agency also said it identified additional initial infection vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform, that have been leveraged by the adversary to mount the attacks, including a previously stolen key to circumvent Duo\\'s multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access the mailbox of a user via Outlook Web App (OWA) service.\\nDigital forensics firm Volexity, which tracks the actor under the moniker Dark Halo, said the MFA bypass was one of the three incidents between late 2019 and 2020 aimed at a US-based think tank.\\nThe entire intrusion campaign came to light earlier this week when FireEye disclosed it had detected a breach that also pilfered its Red Team penetration testing tools.\\nSince then, a number of agencies have been found to be attacked, including the US departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security, and Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and several state department networks.\\nWhile many details continue to remain unclear, the revelation about new modes of attack raises more questions about the level of access the attackers were able to gain across government and corporate systems worldwide.\\nMicrosoft, FireEye, and GoDaddy Create a Killswitch\\nOver the last few days, Microsoft, FireEye, and GoDaddy seized control over one of the main GoDaddy domains — avsvmcloud[.]com — that was used by the hackers to communicate with the compromised systems, reconfiguring it to create a killswitch that would prevent the SUNBURST malware from continuing to operate on victims\\' networks.\\nFor its part, SolarWinds has not yet disclosed how exactly the attacker managed to gain extensive access to its systems to be able to insert malware into the company\\'s legitimate software updates.\\nRecent evidence, however, points to a compromise of its build and software release system. An estimated 18,000 Orion customers are said to have downloaded the updates containing the back door.\\nSymantec, which earlier uncovered more than 2,000 systems belonging to 100 customers that received the trojanized SolarWinds Orion updates, has now confirmed the deployment of a separate second-stage payload called Teardrop that\\'s used to install the Cobalt Strike Beacon against select targets of interest.\\nThe hacks are believed to be the work of APT29, a Russian threat group also known as Cozy Bear, which has been linked to a series of breaches of critical US infrastructure over the past year.\\nThe latest slew of intrusions has also led CISA, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) to issue a joint statement, stating the agencies are gathering intelligence in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors.\\nCalling for stronger steps to hold nation-states accountable for cyberattacks, Smith said the attacks represent \"an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world.\"\\n\"In effect, this is not just an attack on specific targets, but on the trust and reliability of the world\\'s critical infrastructure in order to advance one nation\\'s intelligence agency,\" he added.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'news015.txt': 'State-sponsored actors allegedly working for Russia have targeted the US Treasury, the Commerce Department\\'s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and other government agencies to monitor internal email traffic as part of a widespread cyberespionage campaign.\\nThe Washington Post, citing unnamed sources, said the latest attacks were the work of APT29 or Cozy Bear, the same hacking group that\\'s believed to have orchestrated a breach of US-based cybersecurity firm FireEye a few days ago leading to the theft of its Red Team penetration testing tools.\\nThe motive and the full scope of what intelligence was compromised remains unclear, but signs are that adversaries tampered with a software update released by Texas-based IT infrastructure provider SolarWinds earlier this year to infiltrate the systems of government agencies as well as FireEye and mount a highly-sophisticated supply chain attack.\\n\"The compromise of SolarWinds\\' Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,\" said Brandon Wales, acting director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which has released an emergency directive, urging federal civilian agencies to review their networks for suspicious activity and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately.\\nSolarWinds\\' networking and security products are used by more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including Fortune 500 companies, government agencies, and education institutions.\\nIt also serves several major US telecommunications companies, all five branches of the US Military, and other prominent government organizations such as the Pentagon, State Department, NASA, National Security Agency (NSA), Postal Service, NOAA, Department of Justice, and the Office of the President of the United States.\\nAn Evasive Campaign to Distribute SUNBURST Backdoor\\nFireEye, which is tracking the ongoing intrusion campaign under the moniker \"UNC2452,\" said the supply chain attack takes advantage of trojanized SolarWinds Orion business software updates in order to distribute a backdoor called SUNBURST.\\n\"This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing,\" FireEye said in a Sunday analysis. \"Post compromise activity following this supply chain compromise has included lateral movement and data theft. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor and the operation was conducted with significant operational security.\"\\nThis rogue version of SolarWinds Orion plug-in, besides masquerading its network traffic as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol, is said to communicate via HTTP to remote servers so as to retrieve and execute malicious commands (\"Jobs\") that cover the spyware gamut, including those for transferring files, executing files, profiling and rebooting the target system, and disabling system services.\\nOrion Improvement Program or OIP is chiefly used to collect performance and usage statistics data from SolarWinds users for product improvement purposes.\\nWhat\\'s more, the IP addresses used for the campaign were obfuscated by VPN servers located in the same country as the victim to evade detection.\\nMicrosoft also corroborated the findings in a separate analysis, stating the attack (which it calls \"Solorigate\") leveraged the trust associated with SolarWinds software to insert malicious code as part of a larger campaign.\\n\"A malicious software class was included among many other legitimate classes and then signed with a legitimate certificate,\" the Windows maker said. The resulting binary included a backdoor and was then discreetly distributed into targeted organizations.\"\\nSolarWinds Releases Security Advisory\\nIn a security advisory published by SolarWinds, the company said the attack targets versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 of the SolarWinds Orion Platform software that was released between March and June 2020, while recommending users to upgrade to Orion Platform release 2020.2.1 HF 1 immediately.\\nThe firm, which is currently investigating the attack in coordination with FireEye and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, is also expected to release an additional hotfix, 2020.2.1 HF 2, on December 15, which replaces the compromised component and provides several extra security enhancements.\\nFireEye last week disclosed that it fell victim to a highly sophisticated foreign-government attack that compromised its software tools used to test the defenses of its customers.\\nTotaling as many as 60 in number, the stolen Red Team tools are a mix of publicly available tools (43%), modified versions of publicly available tools (17%), and those that were developed in-house (40%).\\nFurthermore, the theft also includes exploit payloads that leverage critical vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure SSL VPN (CVE-2019-11510), Microsoft Active Directory (CVE-2020-1472), Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central (CVE-2020-10189), and Windows Remote Desktop Services (CVE-2019-0708).\\nThe campaign, ultimately, appears to be a supply chain attack on a global scale, for FireEye said it detected this activity across several entities worldwide, spanning government, consulting, technology, telecom, and extractive firms in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\\nThe indicators of compromise (IoCs) and other relevant attack signatures designed to counter SUNBURST can be accessed here.\\n\\n'}"
